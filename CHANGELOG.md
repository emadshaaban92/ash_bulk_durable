# Changelog

## Unreleased

- First version: durable bulk actions on Oban, kept as `BulkAction` and `Row`
  records, with per-row and all-or-nothing modes, retries, a sheet layer for
  CSV and XLSX, and an errors sheet to correct and upload again.
- `example/`: a Phoenix app with a `/bulk` page to copy, using no other library
  for its screens: organizations and roles a worker acts under, and files in a
  sheet.
- `:oban` config key naming the Oban instance the engine uses for every job
  call, so a host with a named or prefixed instance works. The rescue cron's
  job lookup and the heartbeat now honour the instance's `:prefix`; before,
  on a prefixed host the cron failed every live bulk action.
- The engine's tests at the root, the screens' tests in `example/`, and CI over
  both.
- Row status flips are compare-and-set: `:resolve`, `:mark_succeeded`,
  `:mark_failed` and `:forget_resolutions` match a row only while its status
  is one they may move it from, and are refused as `StaleRecord` otherwise. A
  run whose row moved on under another run of the same bulk action stops
  without writing anything more: a superseded job cancels, the current one
  retries.
- `retry/2` and `retry_row/2` lock the bulk action (`FOR NO KEY UPDATE SKIP
  LOCKED`, through the new `Core.BulkActionLock`) before reading or writing
  any of its rows, and read the rows and the bulk action's status under that
  lock. A retry while another transaction holds the bulk action, or by a
  caller who doesn't own it, is refused at once with the usual `StaleRecord`,
  before reading any row.
